Q3:Â What are the key things you would consider when creating/consuming an API 
to ensure that it is secure and reliable?
Ans:-
When creating or using an API, key considerations for security and reliability include:

Security Aspects:
Authentication: Use OAuth, API keys, or JWTs to verify users.
Authorization: Ensure users have the right access to data/actions.
Encryption: Protect data in transit (HTTPS) and at rest.
Rate Limiting: Prevent abuse by limiting the number of requests.
Input Validation: Sanitize inputs to avoid data injection risks.
API Gateway: Manage requests, enforce security, and control traffic.
Logging & Monitoring: Track API usage and detect threats/issues.


Reliability Aspects:
Versioning: Keep compatibility with systems during updates.
Documentation: Provide clear guidelines, endpoints, and error codes.
Error Handling: Return helpful error messages for easier debugging.
Performance: Optimize for speed and efficiency.
Resiliency: Ensure availability even if parts of the system fail.
