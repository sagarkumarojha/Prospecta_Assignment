1. How will you tackle the challenge above?

I will tackle the challenge of processing a CSV file 
with plain values and formulas by following this approach:

Parse the CSV File: Use OpenCSV to read the data from the CSV file.

Evaluate Formulas with Apache POI: For cells containing formulas:

Implement logic to parse and evaluate formulas using Apache POI, such as =A1+B1.
Replace cell references with actual values and compute the results.
Automatically Generate the Updated File: After processing, use Apache POI 
to generate a new CSV or Excel file with the updated data.

Handle Errors with Spring Boot: Utilize Spring Bootâ€™s error-handling mechanisms to 
manage and log errors effectively, such as invalid formulas or data inconsistencies, 
and ensure the output file is created only if processing is successful.

2. What type of errors would you check for?
When processing CSV files with formulas, we should check for:

Invalid Formulas:
    Syntax Errors: 
       Ensure the formulas are correctly formatted.
    Unrecognized Functions: 
        Handle cases where the formula contains unsupported functions.
Missing References:
   Undefined Variables: Ensure that references like A1 exist in the CSV and handle missing or out-of-bounds references.
Data Type Mismatches:
     Non-Numeric Values: Handle cases where numeric operations encounter non-numeric values.
Parsing Errors:
    Incorrect CSV Formatting: Account for malformed CSV files, such as wrong delimiters or inconsistent row lengths.
File Handling Errors:
    Empty or Corrupted Files: Ensure the input file is not empty or unreadable.



3. How might a user break your code?
users might break the code by:
    Malformed CSV File:
        Uploading a CSV with improper formatting (e.g., missing commas, inconsistent row lengths) could cause parsing failures.
    Complex Formulas:
        Using unsupported or overly complex formulas might result in errors or incorrect results.
    Missing References:
        If a formula references cells that don't exist or are empty, this could lead to calculation errors or exceptions.
    Large Files:
        Handling huge CSV files inefficiently could lead to memory issues or performance slowdowns.
    Non-Numeric Values in Numeric Operations:
        Including non-numeric values in cells expected to contain numbers might lead to errors or crashes during calculations.
